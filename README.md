# Sarcastic Detection with Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning solution for detecting sarcasm in text using a variety of classification models, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector, and Gradient Boosting.

## Overview

- Implemented a machine learning project for sarcastic detection.
- Utilized a range of classification models to enhance accuracy.
- Web application built using Streamlit for easy interaction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in the project's documentation.
3. Run the Python file for the web app, and it will open in your browser.

You can then input text and utilize the different classification models to detect sarcasm efficiently.
